# Critical Path Method for Project Management written in C

This is the software I created using C in linux Fedora 33. YOu may download it and use it for your own personal use. 
This software has no warranty . Please watch my video on youtube for the demo. It will run natively on linux.

To run the code in the linux command line: 
./cpmv01 data.csv

or to just compute cpm on a range of task (e.g. taskA to task d )
./cpmv01 data.csv 4

If you are going to create your own csv file, please follow the format indicated in the data.csv to
avoid any errors.
